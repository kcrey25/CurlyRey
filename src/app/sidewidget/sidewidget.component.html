Hey, guys! We are the Christensens. We love camping, softball, and Mexican food.
Casey is the logical one who builds the website, Brianna is the creative one who
makes the designs, and Paxton is the cute little curly head who is more often than
not unloading something  and/or jabbering (having a one year old is kind of a whirlwind,
but also kind of the best thing ever). We have big dreams, big plans, and are pretty much
obsessed with each other.

  So why the name, Curly Rey? Here’s the thing: my boys are my world. Rey is Casey’s middle
  name, which we lovingly decided to pass on to Paxton. Not only is it a family name, but it
  also means “King” in Spanish. Casey is the king of my heart, and Paxton is the king of everything
  else (ha). Pax may be extremely stubborn and very vocal for a one year old, but he is our miracle
  baby. His curls are the thing that people comment on the most- I mean, how could you not? They are
  so fun, and to me, they just sum Pax and his huge personality right up. So there you have it. It’s
  all about my boys- my biggest inspirations.
